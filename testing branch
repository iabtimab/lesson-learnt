Awesome, Benjamin! You're doing great. Git is telling you:

- You're on the `master` branch.
- You haven't made any commits yet.
- There's one untracked file: `recalling lesson learnt`

This means Git sees the file but isn‚Äôt tracking it yet. Let‚Äôs fix that.

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Track and Commit the File

#### 1. **Stage the file**
```bash
git add "recalling lesson learnt"
```
If the filename has spaces, wrap it in quotes.

#### 2. **Commit the file**
```bash
git commit -m "Add recalling lesson learnt"
```

Now Git will save that file in your local repository.

### üîç Check Your Work

After committing, run:
```bash
git status
```
You should see:
```
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

And to view your commit:
```bash
git log --oneline
```
